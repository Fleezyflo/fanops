# Decision Record v4 — OpenCV / smart-framing: one construction, fail loud

**Status:** experimental commit on `fix/cv2-required-fail-loud` (PR #633). **Not merged.**
Supersedes v3 and the `22f3380` non-constructing "Fix B", which was correctly rejected: it let a broken
prerequisite (corrupt ONNX / OpenCV ABI mismatch / `create()` failure) fall through to CENTERED output.

**Governing acceptance criterion:** a missing or broken prerequisite must refuse loudly and must never be
normalized into centered output. Centered output is permitted only for a genuine detection miss *after* the
prerequisite has been successfully initialized.

Plus this record and two added tests (OFF-contract + runtime lifetime) in the follow-up commit.

The key reversal vs `22f3380`: `require_cv2`'s non-constructing attr+file check is REPLACED by a real
construction (`_framing_runtime_or_raise`), and `render_account_cut` no longer swallows the refusal.

## 2. The one-construction, fail-loud design

`framing._FramingRuntime{cv2, detector}` — a per-resolution object (NOT a process-global).

`framing._framing_runtime_or_raise(cfg)` — the sole constructor AND the prerequisite gate:
1. `_cv2()` is None → `ToolchainMissingError`
2. `cv2.FaceDetectorYN.create` attr missing (OpenCV too old) → `ToolchainMissingError`
3. vendored ONNX absent → `ToolchainMissingError`
4. the real `FaceDetectorYN.create` **raises** → caught and re-raised as `ToolchainMissingError` (`from e`)
5. the real `FaceDetectorYN.create` returns **None** → `ToolchainMissingError`
6. else → the runtime carrying the constructed detector

`clip._resolve_framing` calls it ONCE and threads `_rt=` into `detect_window` / `speaker_track` /
`subject_focus` / `motion_saliency`, which reuse `_rt.detector` (or `_rt.cv2` for saliency). A genuine
detection miss still returns `(None,None,None)` centered; a broken prerequisite never reaches that path.

**Production defect this exposed and fixed:** `clip.render_account_cut`'s outer
`except Exception: return False, None` was SWALLOWING the prerequisite refusal into a centered fail-open. It
now `except ToolchainMissingError: raise` before the broad catch (only ffmpeg/parse failures fail open).
`render_moment` and `_supercut_span_entries` already propagate.

## 3. Constructor-return-`None` and constructor-exception results

Direct-call harness (real cv2 5.0.0, py3.12.8) and the committed tests:
- `create()` → None ⇒ `_resolve_framing` RAISES `ToolchainMissingError` ✓
- `create()` raises ⇒ RAISES `ToolchainMissingError` ✓
- constructor failure does NOT reach detection (`detect_window` call count == 0 on refusal) ✓ — so it cannot
  become centered output
- detector built OK + no face found ⇒ `(None,None,None)` centered, NO raise ✓

## 4. Per-entry-point refusal results

`_resolve_framing` refuses on: cv2 None ✓ · `FaceDetectorYN`/`.create` missing ✓ · model absent ✓ ·
`create()`→None ✓ · `create()` raises ✓.
`render_moment` refuses ✓ · `render_account_cut` refuses ✓ (this test **caught the swallow defect** in §2) ·
`_supercut_span_entries` refuses ✓ · no autouse/suite-wide bypass exists ✓ (asserted against `conftest.py`).
The five router `require_cv2 = lambda` stubs are REMOVED — cv2 is genuinely installed in the unit lane, so the
real runtime builds and the stubbed DETECTION functions drive the routing.

### 4a. OFF contract — the runtime is NOT constructed when smart framing is OFF

`clip._resolve_framing` evaluates the toggle FIRST:
```python
if not cfg.smart_framing:
    return None, None, None          # centered; no runtime, no cv2
rt = framing._framing_runtime_or_raise(cfg)
```
`test_resolve_off_never_constructs_runtime` stubs BOTH `_framing_runtime_or_raise` and `_cv2` to raise
`AssertionError` if called, sets `FANOPS_SMART_FRAMING=0`, and asserts `(None,None,None)`. **Negative control
run:** with the ordering deliberately inverted (runtime built before the toggle check) the test FAILS with
"framing runtime CONSTRUCTED while smart_framing is OFF" — so it is a real guard, not a tautology. The retained
OFF path therefore does not require OpenCV.

### 4b. Object lifetime / concurrency — the runtime never crosses concurrent work

The runtime is created inside each `_resolve_framing` invocation and is never stored in module, config, source,
or any shared cache (`framing.py`: constructed at the `return _FramingRuntime(...)` and held only in the caller's
local `rt`; no `global`, no module cache).
`test_framing_runtime_is_per_invocation_never_shared` asserts, over 2 sequential + 2 concurrent
(`ThreadPoolExecutor`) resolutions: **4 distinct `_FramingRuntime` objects and 4 distinct detector objects**, and
that no `_FramingRuntime` is retained in `vars(framing)`, on the `Config`, or on the `Source`. This is why YuNet's
mutable `setInputSize` state is safe: no detector is ever shared across concurrent resolutions.

## 5. Actual CI ffmpeg probe (`scripts/ci_env_probe.py`, unit job — MEASURED, not inferred)

CI run 29328162939, unit job:
```
python:  3.12.13
machine: x86_64
ffmpeg:  None          <- shutil.which("ffmpeg"), genuinely absent
ffprobe: None
cv2:     5.0.0         <- present (the [framing] extra, from the hashed lock)
OK: ffmpeg is NOT on PATH in this lane — frame extraction cannot run; detection fails open to centered
```
The probe also logs a loud `NOTE:` if a future `ubuntu-latest` image ever ADDS ffmpeg, so the unit-lane
contract cannot silently rot.

## 6. CI constructor / extraction counts — what CI actually established

**CI passed tests asserting one constructor call per resolution and the expected extraction counts.**
CI did **not** report the numeric values: pytest ran with `-q`, which suppresses the tests' stdout on pass, so
the `[framing-counts]` numbers do not appear in any CI log or artifact. The evidence is the passing assertions
inside `test_one_resolve_constructs_detector_exactly_once` and
`test_framing_construction_and_extraction_counts_reported` (both integration-marked, real OpenCV 5.0.0, x86_64,
e2e job of run 29328162939: `23 passed`).

The numeric values below are from the LOCAL run of the same tests (macOS/arm64, real cv2 5.0.0) and are
reported as local measurements, not CI output:
```
COLD resolution: FaceDetectorYN.create=1  detect_window=1  grid_extract=2
WARM resolution: FaceDetectorYN.create=1  detect_window=1  grid_extract=1
```
Init scope = PER-RESOLUTION: exactly one construction every resolution, never two. The sidecar caches detection
RESULTS, not the detector object, so a warm resolution still constructs one but extracts less.

## 7. Clean-venv base-install results

The `base-install` job creates a LITERAL venv (`python -m venv .venv-base`; `pip install .`, no extras). The
smoke asserts: cv2 ABSENT · `fanops` + CLI import · a representative non-render operation
(`fanops.cli.main(["--help"])`) · the render prerequisite REFUSES. It asserts **nothing** about
smart-framing OFF — that off-switch policy is a separate decision (F3) and is not entrenched here.
Validated in `docker --platform linux/amd64 python:3.12-slim` (exit 0) and **passed in CI** (run 29328162939).

## 8. Linux x86-64 lock-generation evidence

`docker run --platform linux/amd64 python:3.12-slim`:
- container arch **x86_64** · python **3.12.13** · pip-compile **7.5.3**
- `pip-compile --generate-hashes --allow-unsafe --strip-extras --extra dev --extra studio --extra framing --output-file requirements/ci-unit.txt pyproject.toml`
- result: **byte-identical** to the prior ARM64-generated lock — `--generate-hashes` enumerates ALL platform
  wheels (28 opencv wheel hashes across manylinux x86_64/aarch64, macOS, Windows), so the resolution is
  arch-independent here. The `bdist.linux-aarch64` artifact was produced by the smoke's `pip install .` (a local
  wheel build), not by lock generation.
- lock drift guard: pyproject deps unchanged ⇒ not triggered. `--require-hashes` install: PROVEN on x86_64 CI
  (`opencv-python-headless==5.0.0.93`, `numpy==2.5.1` installed from the lock).

## 9. Timing — observed, not causally isolated

**Observed unit duration improved from 78.29s to 72.04s across two different commits. The one-construction
change is the leading explanation, but causal attribution was not isolated.** `22f3380 → 273bef9` changed
production code, tests, CI diagnostics, docs, smoke behavior, and the test count (4820 → 4825), so the delta
cannot be attributed to the guard alone.

Prior baseline for reference: `main` `6061c16c` = 4814 tests / 72.17s. The v3 claim that "+6.12s was caused by
83 detector constructions" is **WITHDRAWN** — construction is one per *resolution*, not per test, and the
suite-wide resolution count was never measured.

SLO: `unit pytest SLO ok: 72.04s <= 135s budget`. An SLO failure would reject the candidate pending profiling;
the budget is not an automatic fallback and was not raised.

## 10. Documentation and deployment findings

- No Dockerfiles, docker-compose files, systemd units, launchd plists, or standalone `requirements*.txt` for a
  production render host exist. FanOps runs as an editable `pip install -e` on the operator's machine driven by
  a launchd daemon — the render host IS the editable install, so there is no separate deploy manifest to audit.
- `[framing]` coverage BEFORE: `README.md` ✓ (already `.[dev,studio,transcribe,framing]`); `docs/RUNBOOK.md` ✗,
  `docs/GOLIVE.md` ✗, `CLAUDE.md` ✗. FIXED: added to all three with the note that smart framing defaults ON and
  the render refuses without it. `pip install 'fanops[framing]'` is now the documented remediation.
- CLI preflight, doctor enhancements, toggle policy, base-dependency policy, and detection-miss telemetry remain
  in their separate follow-up records (F1–F5).

## 11. Final disposition

**Accept for merge**, subject to the operator's judgment on the two open product decisions below (neither is a
defect in this candidate).

Every acceptance criterion is met and CI-verified (run 29328162939 + the follow-up run for the two added tests):
a broken prerequisite refuses loudly at every render entry point and can never become centered output; a genuine
detection miss still centers; the detector is constructed exactly once per resolution; the OFF path builds no
runtime and requires no OpenCV; the runtime never crosses concurrent work; no suite-wide bypass exists; the base
install refuses; the unit lane's ffmpeg-absent/cv2-present contract is measured, not assumed.

**Open product decisions (out of scope here):** the off-switch policy (retain / deprecate / remove — F3) and
cv2-as-base-dependency vs the optional extra (F4).

**Known, accepted cost:** construction is per-resolution and is not amortized across resolutions of the same
source (the sidecar caches results, not the detector), so a warm resolution builds one detector it may not use.
That is the price of re-proving the prerequisite every resolution. A source-scoped runtime cache would require
the thread-safety analysis that a shared YuNet detector demands, and is deliberately not attempted here.

## Retractions carried into v4
- "the rare corrupt-ONNX case still fails open to centered" (v3) — that WAS the defect; v4 constructs and refuses.
- "+6.12s caused by 83 detector constructions" — withdrawn; construction is per-resolution, count unmeasured.
- "only the guard changed between 22f3380 and 273bef9" — false; many things changed (see §9).
- "CI reported the constructor counts" — false; CI passed the assertions, the numbers were not emitted (see §6).
- "the ARM64-generated lock is CI-faithful" — replaced by an amd64 regeneration and the byte-identical finding.
